<p><b>Disclaimer</b></p>
<p>The solutions are all made by me, however they are not 100% correct (I lost a few marks here and there in my implementations),
  so do <b>NOT</b> blindly copy my code! The lab for this module changes every semester so I doubt it can be copied directly
  anyway, but you can use my code as reference if you are stuck!</p>
